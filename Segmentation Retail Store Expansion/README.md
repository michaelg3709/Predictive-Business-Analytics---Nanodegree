Project Overview

You work for a retail store chain in the USA. The company is thinking of expanding to other countries and want to figure out which countries are similar economically, demographically, education, and environment to the USA.

Your manager has asked you to segment the countries of the world based on various economic, demographic, education, and environment data. From this you should be able to provide a list of countries that are similar to the United States. This will be the “short list” for further consideration by management.
